# React Typescript Starter Kit

This is my personal boilerplate for starting up new react apps.
I'm using the following libraries (along with React + Typescript)

- Redux
- Redux Sagas (for async actions)
- Jest
- React Router


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with:

    $ yarn

Launch the app with 

    $ yarn start
    
Please note:
- The console will not give you build progress as it is wrapped with a script.
- Typescript checking is disabled while running the development server for speed reasons. If you would like to check types at build time, please run `npx tsc` from your terminal. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

    $ yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    $ yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

    $ yarn build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
